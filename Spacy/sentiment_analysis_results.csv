More shedding than my dog!!,"I wanted to like the bed and at first it worked great, it fit perfectly in my dogs crate and he seemed to be comfortable enough with it. HOWEVER, it sheds like CRAZY! I had read a review talking about that, but I decided to buy it anyways cus it could’ve just been their bed. Turns out it’s mine too. Every single day I would have to vacuum inside and around on the outside of his crate because the fur balls that would come off the bed were so much that they would get carried out around the living room (where the crates at) by the normal inside air. It was so annoying. Not to mention my dog has allergies and the amount of fur that came off the bed was very uncomfortable for him to the point he couldn’t sleep in his crate with that bed. It was a problem for me because his crate doesn’t have a base (it was a hand-me-down crate) so the bed had to be there or he would be even more uncomfortable. Anyway, point is this bed although seemed to work for the price, now has to been thrown away because it is completely useless to me and no amount of vacuuming stops the fur from coming off. I imagine the bed would have to be furless for that to happen. So waste of money there.",negative,1,"['wanted', 'fit', 'worked', 'fit', 'be', 'comfortable', 'sheds', 'like', 'was', 'has', 'was', 'was', 'be', 'seemed', 'is', 'waste']"

Amazing,So I got the one size regular. I am 5’6 and 176 lbs. I also have a little baby pouch from having kids lol when I first looked at them upon delivery they looked small. I tried them on. There was some extra leg length that bunches up some but not bad. They’re extremely soft. They hid my pouch pretty well. I can also lift my legs high and squat with no feeling of gaining tightness on my legs or anywhere. So they are pretty stretchy as well.

Perfect family beach towel,"This is the perfect beach towel! I wanted something large enough to fit me, my husband, and my young daughter comfortably, along with all of our beach gear that we want to protect from sand.

Proven in a 24hr adventure race,I wore these for a 24hr adventure race and was pleased. I was worried my backside would get overly sore with 90+ miles of biking but faired no worse than I’d expect to in fully padded bike shorts. They held up well over 30+ miles of trekking in that race with no chaffing or discomfort. I did wear UA boxer briefs underneath as I could feel the seam of the pad against my skin without them and didn’t want to risk irritation over that distance.,positive,0,"['was', 'was', 'get', 'get', 'faired', '30', 'chaffing', 'want', 'risk']"

This comforter was an easy wash and dried up great (especially since I had to re wash it after forgetting in the washer ????)! Looks and feels great!

"Best for speech, sturdy, comfy, calls so so.","As other stated the bass sounds are reduced for music, but works terrific for podcasts etc. The power on power off volume cannot be adjusted and should be turned on or off we’re not attached to your ears. It is very very loud. It is easy to have these headphones too loud when trying to override exterior noises, like on a bus or around other’s loud speech. This could result in tinnitus. However they are terrific for listening to things at low-volume without disturbing others, in bed, while they are on phone, etc. Voice to speech text does not work well with this, and background noises are amplified for persons receiving your phone call. This being said the value for money and comfort is hard to beat. It does not have a volume adjustment on the headset, but this can be completed by pushing them further forward from the years to reduce sound or slid back closer to the year to make the volume louder.  These seem very sturdy, long battery life. I have a small head and sensitive este, these don’t hurt me, very comfortable, leaves enough room behind my head to insert a forefinger yet ride well during activity.

When I went to find out what the lights meant, the first time I read that I had an inadequate transformer.  Great! So my first issue with this system is that it can't work with transformers that are already in your house. You have to have a special transformer on your doorbell. If you have anything other than a modern home, you might want to check your transformer before getting this doorbell.  Apparently there is not enough power in the standard transformer for this item.",positive,0,"['was', 'lights', 'indicated', 'transformer', 'Great', 'is', 'is', 'home', 'power']"

A very good no-frills electric brush,"The small rotating brush head works well and reaches all parts of the mouth easily. That's the single most important reason to buy this device. The 30 second stutter reminder is a useful feature to time the brushing of each quadrant. There is no auto shutoff after 2 mins, but I don't find this to be consequential. The entire device is washable under running water, which is necessary each time.  I leave the brush in the charger all the time. The absence of more fancy features is really not a big deal. Basic brushing works very well with the design of the brush head and the reasonably quiet motor. I have to see how long this lasts, but I'd recommend this brush highly.

Beautiful!!!!,"Okay, so I bought 2 of these. The black and the deep blue.  I am 5'6"" and all legs with a short torso. My 6' hubby and I have the same length legs. My waist is about a 40"". I usually wear XL or an XXL if I want it a lil roomier. So, I bought the PLUS on both of them. The dark blue was perfect, but the black was tighter in the waist. Its fine if you dont have tummy issues. But if you do, it will be too tight on your tummy. You must be very careful washing these because they both bleed..even in cold water. And you DO NOT want to dry. These will shrink...a lot!  So all in all, they are spectacular looking...with lots of detail. The black have small beeds on it...making it VERY eye catching. Both have lace on the bottom. Very swishy and feminine. The blue kinda looks like jean material, but isnt.

I was working on the walls in my hallway and since its close quarters I found I had more control without one. I didn't even need to use any kind of soap with them, just a little water.

This is the VERY best tuxedo!!!!!! Look no further....,"This is the VERY best tuxedo choice for any man that wants to look and feel great when attending any formal event.  I was initially concerned about the quality since the price was so affordable. However, I’m really impressed with the quality and design of the tuxedo. It looks exactly as shown in the pictures and the quality is very superb.  The fabric feels just as nice at the ones you rent but you get to keep yours and wear it over and over again!  The pants are unhemmed so you can get your local tailor to hem them to meet your preferred length.  Overall, I give this a thousand stars because the tux is very well made, the price is super affordable and the customer service is superb.  They respond to your questions very quickly and help you find the right size based on your body measurements.  I love them so much that I ordered eight of them for my groom and all his groomsmen for our upcoming wedding.  I highly recommend this tuxedo.  Father’s day is coming up and this is an excellent option for a father’s day gift.

Does the job just fine,"We recently ran out of butane on our old flexible neck gas lighter, which has lasted us near a decade (we obviously don't light many things, other than the occasional birthday candles). Decided to see what's new in the world of lighter technology and saw these newfangled plasma arc lighters and had to give it a try. This brand seems to have the most established presence, and I chose this model because of the extra safety slider over the activation button (seems a bit more failsafe when this goes into a drawer). The lighter does the job just fine, lighting candles with ease. We've already made use of it several times due to a couple recent unexpected power outages. Not sure how well the tip will stand up over time, but it's nice not having to get butane refills.",positive,0,"['neck', 'on', 'saw', 'candles', 'with', 'outages', 'stand', ""'s""]"
