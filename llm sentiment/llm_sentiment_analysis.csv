More shedding than my dog!!,"I wanted to like the bed and at first it worked great, it fit perfectly in my dogs crate and he seemed to be comfortable enough with it. HOWEVER, it sheds like CRAZY! I had read a review talking about that, but I decided to buy it anyways cus it could’ve just been their bed. Turns out it’s mine too. Every single day I would have to vacuum inside and around on the outside of his crate because the fur balls that would come off the bed were so much that they would get carried out around the living room (where the crates at) by the normal inside air. It was so annoying. Not to mention my dog has allergies and the amount of fur that came off the bed was very uncomfortable for him to the point he couldn’t sleep in his crate with that bed. It was a problem for me because his crate doesn’t have a base (it was a hand-me-down crate) so the bed had to be there or he would be even more uncomfortable. Anyway, point is this bed although seemed to work for the price, now has to been thrown away because it is completely useless to me and no amount of vacuuming stops the fur from coming off. I imagine the bed would have to be furless for that to happen. So waste of money there.","Here are the aspects and sentiments extracted from the review:

"Best for speech, sturdy, comfy, calls so so.","As other stated the bass sounds are reduced for music, but works terrific for podcasts etc. The power on power off volume cannot be adjusted and should be turned on or off we’re not attached to your ears. It is very very loud. It is easy to have these headphones too loud when trying to override exterior noises, like on a bus or around other’s loud speech. This could result in tinnitus. However they are terrific for listening to things at low-volume without disturbing others, in bed, while they are on phone, etc. Voice to speech text does not work well with this, and background noises are amplified for persons receiving your phone call. This being said the value for money and comfort is hard to beat. It does not have a volume adjustment on the headset, but this can be completed by pushing them further forward from the years to reduce sound or slid back closer to the year to make the volume louder.  These seem very sturdy, long battery life. I have a small head and sensitive este, these don’t hurt me, very comfortable, leaves enough room behind my head to insert a forefinger yet ride well during activity.  I can also wear sunglasses with them, or one earpiece for two way radio and still get good benefit from the headphones.","Here are the extracted aspects and sentiments:

When I went to find out what the lights meant, the first time I read that I had an inadequate transformer.  Great! So my first issue with this system is that it can't work with transformers that are already in your house. You have to have a special transformer on your doorbell.

A very good no-frills electric brush,"The small rotating brush head works well and reaches all parts of the mouth easily. That's the single most important reason to buy this device. The 30 second stutter reminder is a useful feature to time the brushing of each quadrant. There is no auto shutoff after 2 mins, but I don't find this to be consequential. The entire device is washable under running water, which is necessary each time.  I leave the brush in the charger all the time. The absence of more fancy features is really not a big deal. Basic brushing works very well with the design of the brush head and the reasonably quiet motor. I have to see how long this lasts, but I'd recommend this brush highly. Only reservation is that the price seems a little high for this setup.","Here are the aspects and sentiments extracted from the review:

I usually wear XL or an XXL if I want it a lil roomier. So, I bought the PLUS on both of them. The dark blue was perfect, but the black was tighter in the waist. Its fine if you dont have tummy issues. But if you do, it will be too tight on your tummy. You must be very careful washing these because they both bleed..even in cold water. And you DO NOT want to dry. These will shrink...a lot!  So all in all, they are spectacular looking...with lots of detail. The black have small beeds on it...making it VERY eye catching.

works to get smoke and nicotine off walls,"I love this product! I would definitely buy them again. I was looking for a way to clean 20 yrs of smoke and nicotine off my walls. Anyone who has ever done this knows just how difficult of a task it is. None of the various spray cleaning products I tried would work. I even tried using a vinegar solution without success. Out of desperation I tried a regular magic eraser on a test spot as a last resort before giving up and it came right off with little to no scrubbing! So when I saw they made a mop I just had to order a box. It absolutely worked wonders.  I did not use them on a mop handle though. I was working on the walls in my hallway and since its close quarters I found I had more control without one. I didn't even need to use any kind of soap with them, just a little water. The only improvement I feel would be necessary would be to make the magic eraser part of the sponge mop head a little thicker. I was afraid it wasn't going to be thick enough but it still got the job done.","Aspects:

They respond to your questions very quickly and help you find the right size based on your body measurements.
