More shedding than my dog!!,"I wanted to like the bed and at first it worked great, it fit perfectly in my dogs crate and he seemed to be comfortable enough with it. HOWEVER, it sheds like CRAZY! I had read a review talking about that, but I decided to buy it anyways cus it could’ve just been their bed. Turns out it’s mine too. Every single day I would have to vacuum inside and around on the outside of his crate because the fur balls that would come off the bed were so much that they would get carried out around the living room (where the crates at) by the normal inside air. It was so annoying. Not to mention my dog has allergies and the amount of fur that came off the bed was very uncomfortable for him to the point he couldn’t sleep in his crate with that bed. It was a problem for me because his crate doesn’t have a base (it was a hand-me-down crate) so the bed had to be there or he would be even more uncomfortable. Anyway, point is this bed although seemed to work for the price, now has to been thrown away because it is completely useless to me and no amount of vacuuming stops the fur from coming off. I imagine the bed would have to be furless for that to happen. So waste of money there.","[""1. **Shedding**: The reviewer found that the bed sheds excessively, to the point where it's comparable to their dog's shedding.""]",['1.'],Thank you for your feedback!

Amazing,So I got the one size regular. I am 5’6 and 176 lbs. I also have a little baby pouch from having kids lol when I first looked at them upon delivery they looked small. I tried them on. There was some extra leg length that bunches up some but not bad. They’re extremely soft. They hid my pouch pretty well. I can also lift my legs high and squat with no feeling of gaining tightness on my legs or anywhere. So they are pretty stretchy as well. I’m happy with them.,"['1.

Perfect family beach towel,"This is the perfect beach towel! I wanted something large enough to fit me, my husband, and my young daughter comfortably, along with all of our beach gear that we want to protect from sand. It comes with stakes and packets to fill with sand to weigh it down, which is great so I don’t have to worry about putting something in each corner.

Proven in a 24hr adventure race,I wore these for a 24hr adventure race and was pleased.

*For ATH-M50X* About low-star reviews.,"Okay, so let's nip this in the bud.

Uneven flavor.,I love this kind of popcorn and I decided to give the bowl a try. The butter does not distribute evenly over all the popcorn (in all 12 buckets) and there’s extreme amount of salt. You’ll be satisfied at first with its buttery taste but as you get further down into the bowl there’s hardly any flavor.

"Best for speech, sturdy, comfy, calls so so.","As other stated the bass sounds are reduced for music, but works terrific for podcasts etc. The power on power off volume cannot be adjusted and should be turned on or off we’re not attached to your ears. It is very very loud. It is easy to have these headphones too loud when trying to override exterior noises, like on a bus or around other’s loud speech. This could result in tinnitus. However they are terrific for listening to things at low-volume without disturbing others, in bed, while they are on phone, etc. Voice to speech text does not work well with this, and background noises are amplified for persons receiving your phone call. This being said the value for money and comfort is hard to beat. It does not have a volume adjustment on the headset, but this can be completed by pushing them further forward from the years to reduce sound or slid back closer to the year to make the volume louder.  These seem very sturdy, long battery life. I have a small head and sensitive este, these don’t hurt me, very comfortable, leaves enough room behind my head to insert a forefinger yet ride well during activity.  I can also wear sunglasses with them, or one earpiece for two way radio and still get good benefit from the headphones.",['* Sound quality for speech'],['* Positive sentiment for:'],Thank you for your positive feedback!

Not a perfect fit but it works well and costs 1/3 of the OEM part,"I replaced the original light on our 2012 Armada with this assembly. No issues getting everything hooked up, it's just a pain to get to the light. I actually liked that it didn't come with any pigtails for anything, so I just disconnected everything from the old light after I removed it from the spoiler. I didn't have to run anything back through the liftgate. The fit is not 100% perfect, as the gap at the edge between the light and the cutout in the spoiler is slightly larger than it needs to be. It's not noticeably off, though. Hard to knock it for the price - $40 plus tax. Cheapest I could find from Nissan was about $123. Next cheapest is Dorman for $90.","['1.

Can't Give a Good Rating if It Doesn't Work,"I bought this thing with high hopes but was very disappointed in the end.  I followed all the instructions to install it and got to the point where you turn the power on and connect it to your network.  When I did that, I didn't get the expected white LED lights on the doorbell. I got some other version that indicated a problem.  When I went to find out what the lights meant, the first time I read that I had an inadequate transformer.  Great! So my first issue with this system is that it can't work with transformers that are already in your house. You have to have a special transformer on your doorbell.

A very good no-frills electric brush,"The small rotating brush head works well and reaches all parts of the mouth easily. That's the single most important reason to buy this device. The 30 second stutter reminder is a useful feature to time the brushing of each quadrant. There is no auto shutoff after 2 mins, but I don't find this to be consequential. The entire device is washable under running water, which is necessary each time.  I leave the brush in the charger all the time. The absence of more fancy features is really not a big deal. Basic brushing works very well with the design of the brush head and the reasonably quiet motor. I have to see how long this lasts, but I'd recommend this brush highly. Only reservation is that the price seems a little high for this setup.","['1. Brush head: Works well, small and rotating, reaches all parts of the mouth easily']","['1.

Beautiful!!!!,"Okay, so I bought 2 of these. The black and the deep blue.  I am 5'6"" and all legs with a short torso. My 6' hubby and I have the same length legs. My waist is about a 40"". I usually wear XL or an XXL if I want it a lil roomier. So, I bought the PLUS on both of them. The dark blue was perfect, but the black was tighter in the waist. Its fine if you dont have tummy issues. But if you do, it will be too tight on your tummy. You must be very careful washing these because they both bleed..even in cold water. And you DO NOT want to dry. These will shrink...a lot!  So all in all, they are spectacular looking...with lots of detail. The black have small beeds on it...making it VERY eye catching. Both have lace on the bottom. Very swishy and feminine. The blue kinda looks like jean material, but isnt. Deninitely worth the buy!!",['1.
